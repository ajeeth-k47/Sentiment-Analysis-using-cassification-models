# Sentiment-Analysis-using-classification-models
This project is about sentiment analysis of customer reviews of laptop and restaurant datasets. I did this group project work as part of my master subject( Data Driven Modeling ). We have used KNN and Decision Tree model to train the datasets and predicted the kind of review ( Positive / Negative / Neutral ). We have followed all the steps like reading the dataset, constructing the dataframe, data exploration, data preprocessing ( using NLTK ), data cleaning, split the dataset into train and test dataset before training the model. Finally we have also evaluated the predicted result and compared the result of differnt model.
